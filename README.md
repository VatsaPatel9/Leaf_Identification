# Leaf_identification
A model which can predict an image of a leaf. If an image of a leaf is being fed into the machine, the machine will read and understand the type leaf and give the description(category, type, herbal ,etc).

Designed a CNN model to classify 8 different types of plants with 2136 test images and 614 validation images. Image processing and augmentation was used to generate more data from an existing dataset, this was done because the original dataset was made up of image of plants captured in a specific environment. Increased the test accuracy of the original dataset to augmented dataset from 80% to 90%.


# Dataset:
Dataset was used from leafsnap and then altered according to the requirement

# Library used:
Tensoflow, keras, matplotlib are been used into the code

# Details:
Every detail is being tried to explain in the code by using comments after evey line
